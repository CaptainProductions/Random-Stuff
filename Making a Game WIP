Something like, Squirrel Jump,\n where you play as a squirrel on a trampoline and you\n continually bounce higher, and the higher you get,\n the harder it gets to land on the trampoline.\n Or, you can take 2 games/activities, and mix them.\n What would Slither.io and Minecraft make? \nA game where you are a snake like in slither,\n but you can place different blocks to \nserve as obstructions or weapons?\nOne last method you could use is switch the time and\nplace of two different game, like Tiny Tower in the \nMiddle Ages.\nKnow your skill level and what you can actually make.",15,355);
